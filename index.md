I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at The University of Melbourne. Currently, I'm working with 
<a href="https://patanamon.com/">Dr Patanamon (Pick) Thongtanunam </a> on empirical software engineering research, focusing on automated code review. My current work emphasizes the importance of high-quality datasets and challenges such as hallucinations to ensure the reliability and trustworthiness of machine learning systems in software engineering.

I was awarded a PhD in Natural Language Processing under the supervision of <a href="https://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/tcohn/">Trevor Cohn</a> and <a href="https://www.frermann.de//">Lea Frermann</a>. My research interests center around understanding the structure and relationships between concepts through interdisciplinary perspectives, including NLP and cognitive psychology. With a specific emphasis on understanding the structure and reasons behind human word associations, evaluating the potential of word associations as a source of commonsense knowledge and incorporating commonsense knowledge to improve neural models' reasoning ability on tasks, such as commonsense question answering and natural language inferences.  </br>

This naturally evolved into an exploration of how these concept networks vary across languages and cultures. As my research progressed, I became increasingly intrigued by how computational models learn and understand these cultural differences. This sparked a long-term research agenda that Iâ€™m eager to pursue further: exploring how cultural differences shape our daily behaviours and norms, and how these can be learnt and aligned by NLP models such as large-language models. This work will contribute to the long-term goal of building more inclusive and collaborative AI systems that align with the diverse cultures and values of global human societies.
